# Movie Discovery

Movie Discovery is a web application designed to provide users with a Netflix-like experience for discovering movies. By leveraging The Movie Database (TMDb) API, users can fetch movies based on genre, actor, rating, and other criteria. This project aims to create a unique and interactive platform for users to explore and interact with movie data.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a web application that serves as a creative interface between the end-user and the data fetched from the TMDb API. The application should provide a valuable or entertaining experience by displaying, organizing, or manipulating the data in an innovative manner.

## Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies based on various criteria such as genre, actor, rating, release year, etc.
- **Browse by Genre**: Users can explore movies by browsing through different genres and sub-genres.
- **Actor Search**: Users can discover movies featuring their favorite actors or actresses.
- **Top Rated Movies**: Display a curated list of top-rated movies based on user ratings and reviews.
- **Interactive Interface**: The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enhances the browsing and discovery experience.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Implement a feature for providing personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and viewing history.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (or any other frontend framework/library of choice)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (optional if backend functionality is required)
- **Database**: NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) or SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing user preferences and viewing history
- **API**: The Movie Database (TMDb) API for fetching movie data

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the backend (if required) by installing dependencies and configuring the database connection.
3. Set up the frontend by installing dependencies and configuring API access.
4. Start the development server.
5. Begin developing and implementing features according to the project requirements.

## Note

- This is an individual assignment, but collaboration with teammates is encouraged for peer support and learning.
- We recommend completing the assignment within the first week to allow time for feedback and iteration before the deadline.
